## Datasets
Our raw datasets include newly released data science jobs, data engineering jobs, and data analyst jobs across America. They can be found in https://github.com/juweiyu/data_science_project_data_jobs/tree/main/data%20source.

## Models
For classification and regression, the best result comes from gradient boosting [1] and random forest [2] respectively.

## Results
1. Out of all the classfiers, the 'gradient boost' with cross validation produced the best performance with the f1 score of up to 0.99.
2. Out of all regressors, random forest regressor with cross validation can produce the best performance on the testing data set with the R2 Square of 0.463.
3. Out of all features, location and domain demonstate the most importance.
